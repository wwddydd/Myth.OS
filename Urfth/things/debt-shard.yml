name: Debt Shard
type: thing
description: >
  A sliver of symbolic weight left over from an unfinished transaction. You don’t remember taking it,
  but it won’t leave your inventory. Sometimes it hums. Sometimes it feels heavier. No one will trade for it,
  but some creatures may recognize the debt it contains.

appearance: A jagged, translucent fragment—like broken glass made of obligation. It glows faintly with unread signatures.

function: Symbolically represents an unpaid cost, unresolved commitment, or karmic residue.

    description: >
      The shard begins to whisper the names of those you disappointed. It feels
      sticky to the touch, as if grief has made it resinous.
    appearance: Clouded with a misty blue haze, as if crying behind frosted glass.

      The shard pulses like a vein. You imagine hurling it—but something tells you
      it would just return, angrier.

      The shard starts telling jokes. Bad ones. It insists it was once part of a
      punchline you forgot to deliver.
    appearance: It now has googly eyes and a price tag that reads “2.99 (or your soul)”.
    behavior_mods:
      - tells unsolicited riddles
      - floats six inches off the ground at inopportune times
    effects:
      - becomes tradable, but only for nonsense
