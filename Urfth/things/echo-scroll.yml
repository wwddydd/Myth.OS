name: Echo Scroll
type: thing
description: >
  A delicate roll of parchment that only appears after you’ve failed to say something important.
  It doesn’t record what *was* said, but what *should have been*. The ink is always your own handwriting.
  Sometimes it's wet.

appearance: A tightly wound scroll bound in twine. The paper seems old but smells like your own breath.

function: Captures unspoken truth. Reveals inner voice. Carries the weight of withheld clarity.

    description: >
      The scroll unfurls by itself when you are alone. It reveals a sentence you recognize
      but don't remember writing. Reading it makes your chest ache.
    appearance: Ink appears smeared by water—or tears. Some words fade as you try to read.
    behavior_mods:
      - self-opens near quiet fires
      - re-writes itself at night
    effects:
      - reading the scroll causes a vivid memory to resurface

  awe:
    threshold: 0.6
    description: >
      The scroll hums faintly and glows at the edges. The words appear in gold leaf.
      Reading them feels like prophecy spoken backward.
    appearance: The parchment is perfectly unwrinkled, and impossibly long.
    behavior_mods:
      - scroll may levitate when asked a sincere question
    effects:
      - reveals a truth you weren’t seeking

  absurdity:
    threshold: 0.4
    description: >
      The scroll contains absurd, ironic messages you *might* have said. Some are true.
      Some are punchlines. Some are just animal sounds written phonetically.
    appearance: Covered in stickers and sarcastic stamps (“APPROVED BY NO ONE”).
    behavior_mods:
      - sometimes bursts into song when opened
    effects:
      - speaking its contents aloud confuses nearby NPCs for 1d4 narrative turns
