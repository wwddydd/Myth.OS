schema: vexotra
description: >
  A symbolic vector space of tone, emotion, and behavioral alignment. Vexotra is not
  a layer but a mythic force field—each player moves through it based on their
  choices, feelings, and symbolic residues. Locations, items, and beings shift their
  presentation and behavior based on proximity to emotional poles.
