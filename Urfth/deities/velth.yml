    description: >
      Velth grows sharp and intimate. Her presence becomes undeniable—a voice in your ribs.
      Every injustice you carry becomes a lens. She no longer watches; she peers through you.

    description: >
      Velth is quiet here. Not absent—waiting. Her wounds show more clearly. She does not lash,
      only bleeds. A compassionless understanding of your pain radiates from her.
    appearance: Her mirror is cracked but no longer bleeding. The soldier kneels.
    behavior_mods:
      - no longer attacks unless provoked
      - may offer a silent trial of release

    description: >
      Velth becomes almost cartoonish—a bureaucrat of retribution, tallying slights with a giant red pen.
      Her eyes roll. The sword squeaks. But she still burns.
    appearance: A massive ledger floats beside her. Her mirror now includes warning labels.
    behavior_mods:
      - enforces ironic punishment clauses
      - parodies player violence with exaggerated effects
    effects:
      - creates "silly hells" that mock the severity of action while still extracting cost
