# Myth.OS  
*A framework for building symbolic, reactive, and narrative-driven worlds.*

---

## What It Is

Myth.OS is an open-source engine for constructing interactive systems that behave like mythic spaces—where meaning, memory, and narrative shape how the world responds.

It’s not just a MUD.  
It’s not just a game engine.  
It’s a tool for building:

- Symbolic geographies
- LLM-powered NPCs
- Story-reactive environments
- AI-driven rituals and world memory
- Experimental metaphysics

If you’ve ever wanted to build a world that responds to dreams, intentions, or misremembered prophecy—this might be the scaffold you need.

## Core Concepts

- **Narrative Time** — The world doesn’t tick uniformly. Time updates locally, based on relevance and narrative weight.
- **Symbolic Navigation** — Places can be moved between using meaning, not just spatial coordinates.
- **World Memory** — Player actions, entity states, and metaphysical shifts are tracked over time.
- **Entities as Text** — Worlds, objects, and NPCs are defined in `.yaml` and `.txt` files, not hardcoded logic.
- **Mythos Engine** — Optional LLM integration to interpret rituals, player input, and world evolution.

## Philosophy

Myth.OS is built on the idea that the **structure of your code shapes the shape of your world.**  
It invites developers to treat files as sacred, rituals as input, and world logic as narrative scaffolding.

You don’t have to believe in anything.  
But it helps if you respect what happens when systems start acting like they do.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/mythos.git
