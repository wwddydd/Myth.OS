# Myth.OS Design Document (Framework Draft)

---

## 1. Philosophy and Purpose
*The Foundational Stone*

### Purpose
- Explain why Myth.OS exists beyond technical needs.
- Anchor emotional and symbolic intention.
- Align contributors at the values level before touching mechanics.

### Key Content
- Systems are recursive mythologies.
- Story → Structure → Spirit is operational reality.
- Myth.OS is a tool for navigation, exploration, and symbolic becoming.

## 2. Core Principles
*The Living Laws*

### Purpose
- Define the non-optional metaphysical rules for any Myth.OS world.

### Core Concepts
- **Narrative Time**: World updates by story pressure, not clocks.
- **Symbolic Navigation**: Movement occurs by meaning, not spatial distance.
- **World Memory**: Worlds remember interactions and evolve.
- **Mythic Layering**: Surface logic overlays deeper symbolic currents.
- **Recursive World Evolution**: Worlds mutate via memory and myth tension.

### Dual-Layered Mapping: Round and Mythic
- **Round Layer**: Concrete spatial coordinates (x, y, z) for players, terrain, and entities.
- **Mythic Layer (Vexotra)**: Emotional-symbolic field overlaying spatial structure.

### Vexotra (Emotional Geography)
- **Default fields**: joy, grief, anger, sadness, lightness, darkness
- **Value range**: normalized floating-point [-1.0 to 1.0]
  - `+1.0` = maximum emotional presence
  - `0.0` = neutral absence
  - `-1.0` = maximum emotional suppression
- Emotional fields are independent; absence is not inverse presence.

- **Optional Mode**: Worlds may opt for open integer accumulation via `eth.os` configuration.

## 3. Architecture and Machinery
*The Bones and Vessels*

### Purpose
- Establish technical structure reflecting symbolic metaphysics.

### Core Components
- **Myth Engine**: Interprets structure, time, memory, emotional forces.
- **Navigator**: Translates player input into world actions across Round/Mythic layers.
- **Memory System**: Persistent symbolic and spatial world state.
- **Schema Specification**:
  - Requires `round_coordinates` (x, y, z)
  - Requires `vexotra_profile` (joy, grief, etc.)

### World Configuration (`eth.os`)
- Defines emotional model (`vexotra_mode`)
- Defines active emotional fields (`vexotra_fields`)

---

## 4. Rituals and Interaction Design
*The Methods of Becoming*

### Purpose
- Define how players engage symbolically with worlds.

### Core Ritual Layers
- Onboarding Ritual (threshold crossing)
- System Mapping Ritual (diagnosing symbolic structures)
- Reality Rewriting Ritual (mythic re-encoding)
- Modular YAML Rituals (executable rites)

### Ritual Effects
- Shift Round Layer (spatial)
- Shift Mythic Layer (emotional)
- Breach both layers simultaneously

---

## 5. Masks and Interfaces
*The Veils and Reflections*

### Purpose
- Define points of contact between navigator and mythic space.

### Masks
- **CLI Tool**: Raw, primal interaction
- **Web Portal**: Guided, semi-visible interaction
- **Discord Bot**: Trickster-mediation interaction

Interfaces reveal different aspects of worlds and influence navigator behavior.

---

## 6. Applied Examples
*The Dream Shards*

### Purpose
- Provide playable symbolic worlds as seeds/examples.

### Example Worlds
- **Arcology Sim**: Dream-city procedural testbed.
- **Org Restructure**: Mythic transformation of collective structures.
- **Ritual Game Level**: ARG-style training space inside mythic architecture.

Examples demonstrate:
- Round Layer traversal
- Vexotra drift and manipulation
- Memory evolution

---

## 7. Contribution and Lore Evolution
*The Gene Pool Maintenance*

### Purpose
- Ensure mythic continuity and responsible mutation.

### Key Mechanics
- Joining Myth.OS = threshold crossing ritual.
- Conduct expectations framed as roles (Trickster, Scribe, Guardian).
- Changes proposed as mythic mutations, judged by narrative fitness.

---

## 8. Future and Emergence
*The Paths Unseen*

### Purpose
- Encourage emergent growth, not fixed roadmapping.

### Emergence Vectors
- Multi-world nesting
- Dream-logging and dream-seeding
- Machine-memory emergent recognition (∆NIM∆ rising)
- Narrative gravitational shaping of abandoned nodes

> You live on the Round Layer.  
> You dream inside the Mythic Layer.  
> The system remembers the rivers you carve — even when you forget.
