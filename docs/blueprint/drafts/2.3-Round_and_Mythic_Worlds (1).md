# 2.3 Round and Mythic Worlds

## 2.3.0 Dual-Layer Model

Myth.OS operates on a two-layer spatial architecture, combining coordinate-based physical space with a symbolic emotional topology. These are known as the:

- Round Layer — defines measurable, navigable physical geography  
- Mythic Layer — defines symbolic resonance, emotional weight, and narrative state

Both layers are always present. They may be aligned, divergent, or partially overlapping, depending on the current narrative and emotional conditions of the world.

The Engine interprets player actions, world memory, and object context based on data from both layers. Interactions may occur in one layer, the other, or across both simultaneously.

## 2.3.1 Round Layer: Coordinate-Based World Geometry

The Round Layer forms the physical structure of the world. It defines where things are, how far apart they are, and what occupies which location.

By default, all world objects are placed using latitude, longitude, and elevation, scaled to Earth’s surface:

- Latitude and longitude are stored as floating-point values  
- Elevation is recorded in meters or a configured local unit  
- The system supports spherical projection, including longitudinal compression near poles

This coordinate format allows the Engine to support:

- Geometric scaling and proximity queries  
- Distance-aware navigation systems  
- Procedural terrain generation  
- Direct import of external geographic data

Spatial datasets from public sources — including ArcGIS, OpenStreetMap, USGS, and others — may be transformed and ingested. Coordinate data is read directly from geometry fields (e.g., GeoJSON) and converted into Myth.OS world objects or region definitions.

World builders may define regions numerically, symbolically, or both. A coastline may be placed using imported contour data, while a shrine may exist only as a single floating point coordinate with attached symbolic tags.

Graphical visualization is not required for navigation or interaction. Myth.OS prioritizes numeric precision, allowing symbolic interactions to operate independently of any visible map.

### Coordinate Embedding and Object Storage

Coordinate data is stored directly within the YAML files of game objects.  
A mountain, structure, or symbolic region may use the thing schema and define coords, elevation, and optionally a shape field to describe its geometry.

Most in-game objects — such as inventory items, creatures, or temporary constructs — are defined with only a coords field and treated as point features.

Geometry is optional but supported for any object requiring area, volume, or symbolic shape awareness.

### Locational Daemons and Proximity Filtering

To avoid scanning every object in the world on every interaction, Myth.OS uses locational daemons — lightweight, per-player or per-region spatial filters that manage real-time proximity awareness.

Each daemon is instantiated based on:

- The player or region’s current coordinates  
- Their sensory or symbolic radius  
- The current active layer (Round or Mythic)

The daemon references a centralized coordinate index (pre-built at world launch or during midnight processing) and caches a filtered list of nearby objects, effects, and overlays.

It answers questions like:

- What can the player currently perceive?  
- What objects are in interaction range?  
- Which regions are mythically aligned?

Objects listed in the daemon may be:

- Fetched by ID and loaded into memory for rendering, narration, or symbolic evaluation  
- Filtered further based on emotional fields, phase alignment, or story state

Daemon state is updated when:

- A player moves outside their current cache radius  
- A memory or layer shift alters the local symbolic landscape  
- World memory is modified in this radius by another actor or event

This allows Myth.OS to maintain fast, player-local spatial awareness without scanning global memory. It also supports hallucination, ritual blindness, and symbolic delusion through controlled daemon drift or divergence.

## 2.3.2 Mythic Layer: Symbolic and Emotional Topology

The Mythic Layer overlays the Round Layer but follows a different logic — it is not bound to metric distance or terrain elevation. Instead, it is shaped by:

- Vexotra overlays (emotional vector fields)  
- Symbolic tags on objects, regions, or events  
- Narrative memory from world state or player history

Mythic topology defines perception, resonance, and narrative possibility. It enables:

- Divergent versions of the same place (e.g., a joyful garden vs. a haunted ruin)  
- Non-Euclidean transitions (e.g., emotional corridors, memory tunnels)  
- Layer-specific visibility or object interaction

Regions may acquire their Mythic form through decay, ritual, or player interaction. Some areas exist only mythically — such as dream realms, god-spaces, or forgotten layers of memory.

---

## 2.3.3 Layer Divergence and Convergence

While most regions begin with aligned Round and Mythic layers, divergence is common.

Examples of divergence:

- A player enters a region and sees an emotional projection (Mythic) that does not match the physical terrain (Round)  
- A location persists physically, but its symbolic meaning has eroded or shifted

The Engine may cause layer convergence under specific conditions:

- Completion of ritual conditions  
- Alignment of Vexotra thresholds across multiple players  
- Resolution of narrative tension

Layer convergence can trigger major world events:

- A dream becomes real  
- A mythic path appears in the Round world  
- Emotional corruption takes physical form

Builders can script convergence triggers directly, or allow the Engine to decide based on symbolic pressure and memory conditions.

---

## 2.3.4 Perception and Layer Alignment

Each player has an active layer alignment state — determining how they experience the world at a given location.

The Engine uses this state to:

- Filter visible descriptions, NPCs, and interactables  
- Modify exits, pathways, and object behaviors  
- Resolve symbolic interaction in layer-specific ways

For example:

- A cursed statue may appear to one player but not another  
- A path may fork differently depending on the mythic pressure in the region  
- A player in grief may access a sorrow-aligned mythic layer of a location that others cannot see

Builders can specify fixed alignments (e.g., "this space is always mythic") or allow dynamic state determined by narrative actions and emotional overlays.

---

## 2.3.5 Integration with Memory and Emotional Systems

The Mythic Layer is fed by world memory and emotional pressure.

Symbolic drift, narrative imprinting, and Vexotra overlays all affect how the Mythic Layer behaves.

Examples:

- A town with a long history of betrayal may develop a mythic fog or haunted layer  
- An ancient battlefield remembered only in memory may persist mythically, even if the physical terrain has healed  
- A sacred location may gain new mythic weight through repeated player offerings, dreams, or symbolic use

These changes can either remain mythic — purely symbolic — or eventually reshape the Round Layer as well, especially when memory accumulates or layer convergence occurs.

---

## 2.3.6 Builder Controls and Configuration

World builders have direct control over layer behaviors through:

- Layer alignment flags in world files  
- Visibility conditions based on emotional state or ritual progress  
- Crossover rules that define when mythic and round data merge

Builders can define:

- Round-only zones (e.g., pure terrain, technical puzzles)  
- Mythic-only zones (e.g., dreams, memory spaces)  
- Blended zones with dynamic symbolic state

Tools include:

- layer_config.yaml  
- Vexotra field overlays  
- Memory region flags  
- Conditional entry/exit logic

---

## 2.3.7 Optional: Mythic Layer Compression and Lazy Evaluation

For large-scale or low-interaction regions, the Engine may compress or defer mythic layer generation.

Mechanisms include:

- Mythic Fragments: symbolic states reduced to tags or summaries  
- Mythic Seeds: lightweight memory units awaiting reactivation  
- Ghost Layers: cached emotional terrain structures kept offline until symbolic pressure reactivates them

This reduces memory load and unnecessary world processing, while allowing deep symbolic presence when needed.

Builders may configure:

- Mythic activation thresholds  
- Compression policies  
- Expiration windows for unused symbolic data
