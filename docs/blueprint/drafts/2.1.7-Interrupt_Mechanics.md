# 2.1.7 Fate Buffer Interrupt Mechanics (Noted for Future Expansion)

---

## Concept Overview

Normally, a Fate Buffer collects intentions and resolves them in a structured collapse.  
However, under certain conditions, external forces or destabilizing factors can *interrupt* an active Fate Buffer before normal resolution occurs.

These are known as **Fate Buffer Interrupts**.

---

## Causes of Interrupt

- **New Entrants:** New players or entities entering the contested space mid-buffer.
- **World Events:** Environmental or narrative shocks (earthquakes, invasions, storms) that impose higher-priority changes.
- **Artifacts or Spells:** Special items or effects that deliberately rupture suspended moments.
- **Decay Breach:** Symbolic infrastructure underpinning the buffer weakens due to neglect, corruption, or overload.

---

## Effects of Interrupt

- Collected intentions may be voided, scrambled, or forcibly reinterpreted.
- Immediate partial resolutions may occur, with new secondary Fate Buffers forming.
- Players may experience fractured memories or diverging versions of the same event.
- World memory may encode multiple competing historical accounts of the event.

## Mythological Framing

- Described in-world as:
  - "Tearing the Veil of Potential"
  - "Fate Snarlings"
  - "Premature Births of Possibility"
- Mythwrights may create artifacts to either stabilize against or intentionally cause Interrupts.

---

## Mechanical Purpose

- Preserves the sense that even suspended moments are alive and vulnerable.
- Introduces chaos and counterplay options for players.
- Adds depth to narrative worldbuilding for settings that include time manipulation, symbolic warfare, or reality disruption.

---

## Current Status

- **Not core to baseline Myth.OS operation.**
- **Reserved for worlds/settings that explicitly support meta-engine physics (e.g., time magic, chaos entities, destabilized symbolic fields).**
- **Candidate for optional module or advanced Mythwright crafting guide.**
