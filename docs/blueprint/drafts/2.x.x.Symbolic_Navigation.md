## 2.3.0 Emotional Fields as Spatial Overlays

In Myth.OS, emotional fields are not abstract ideas — they are layered dimensions mapped directly over physical terrain.

Each region may carry one or more **Vexotra fields**, which represent emotional vectors such as joy, sorrow, awe, or dread. These fields are dynamic and responsive, forming what amounts to an emotional topography. Players move not just through space, but through emotional gradients that shape perception, access, and narrative resonance.

Vexotra fields can be influenced by story events, collective emotional pressure, rituals, or symbolic actions. Over time, emotional topologies evolve — mountains of rage may erode into quiet valleys of acceptance, or stagnant zones of apathy may be disrupted by sudden floods of grief or joy.

## 2.3.1 Vexotra-Gated Layer Access

Not everything in a Myth.OS world is available to everyone at all times.

Some objects, characters, and structures exist within **emotional layers** — versions of reality that can only be accessed when a player’s emotional vector aligns with that of the environment.

A doorway might be invisible unless the player carries sorrow. A bridge might only extend across a chasm for those who have truly known awe. These are not illusions or tricks — they are real structures existing within a reality keyed to feeling.

World elements like this are **stacked** into coexistent layers within the same coordinate space. The world may be physically consistent, but symbolically fragmented — and only aligned players can pass through or perceive what lies within these deeper layers.

## 2.3.2 Layer Transitions and Emotional Gates

Players can transition between emotional layers by altering their own symbolic or emotional state.

This might happen through:
- Dialogue that reshapes character motivation
- Ritual acts, such as burning a letter or singing a forgotten song
- The completion of quests or symbolic milestones
- The application of tokens charged with emotional resonance

Transitions are not always permanent or stable. A player who temporarily feels joy may glimpse a bright corridor they cannot reenter once doubt returns. Another may find themselves trapped in a lower layer until they resolve a lingering rage.

This dynamic approach makes exploration as much about inner transformation as it is about external discovery.

## 2.3.3 Optional: Symbolic Tunneling and Non-Euclidean Movement

Some worlds may support **symbolic tunneling** — a more advanced or surreal mechanic.

In this model, players may move between physically distant locations based on **shared emotional alignment**. For example:
- Two locations across the map, each soaked in grief, might allow a player deeply aligned with sorrow to move between them.
- A region of vengeance might “connect” mythically to another space of wrath, forming a symbolic corridor invisible to others.

Symbolic tunneling is **not a baseline feature**, but when implemented, it enables deeply mythic traversal — where geography bends to resonance.

## 2.3.4 Engine Support and Data Model Notes

Vexotra data is stored as **overlay maps** on top of spatial regions. These maps define how emotional vectors flow and pool across terrain.

Objects, NPCs, and players each store their own emotional coordinates in their YAML files using simple scalar values. For example:

```yaml
vexotra:
  sorrow: 87.2
  awe: -12.5
  rage: 4.3
```

The actual value system (e.g., normalized floats vs open-ended scalars) is defined in each world’s `ETH.os` constitution file.

The Engine resolves access checks by comparing a player's current Vexotra alignment to the emotional threshold of a region, object, or layer. These checks can be strict, fuzzy, or symbolically inverted depending on how the world is authored.

## 2.3.5 Design Uses and Worldbuilding Implications

Emotional Layering allows creators to:
- Stack symbolic worlds without duplicating spatial maps
- Gate progress based on player introspection, not just inventory
- Reveal entire facets of the world only to those in alignment with its emotional resonance

It also supports:
- Mood-dependent secrets  
- Dynamic symbolic architecture  
- Meaning-driven exploration

This system encourages players to inhabit their character’s internal landscape just as much as the external world, forging a direct connection between identity and geography.
