Meaning Quotient

Gas station parking lot vs 

Wrath - infers meaning based on actions; generate macGuffins based on meaning expressed by player, obstacles and boundaries generated BY DESIRES

Multiplayer actions interacting with each other and creating new spheres of influence

How that interacts with Narrative Time Constant and creates novel adventures based on the intersection of different perspectives

Dependent on how much agency you want to give the engine in a particular world, but, for example, one player is playing a squirrel ghathering nuts in the woods. Another is playing a nightmare warlord with his death sword. The two interact, and their vexotra have a certain amount of overlap. This overlapping interest can spawn novel quests in which they are both directed to say, go to a cave, with different goals and outcomes in mind. Each one can also have new macGuffins generated for them to quest after based on their desires, or potentially the same macguffin in different forms. Is this a memory function? I'm thinking no, more like symbolic navigATION or player interaction.
