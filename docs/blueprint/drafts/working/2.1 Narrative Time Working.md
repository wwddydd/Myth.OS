# 2.1 Narrative Time (Working Expansion Layer)

## 2.1.0 Time as a Product of Narrative Density and Pressure

Multiplayer interaction in text-based environments presents a unique challenge:  
Unlike graphical games where players can *see* events unfold — avatars moving, spells flying — text requires interpretation of state, timing, and intent through language alone.  
Traditional multiplayer text engines have struggled to capture dynamic cooperation or conflict because preprogrammed sequences could not easily accommodate fluid, emergent group activity.

The **Narrative Time Constant** solves this by introducing an adaptive model:  
When multiple players act within a shared region or upon the same object, the engine *slows local time* automatically.  
This gives involved entities a moment to submit their intentions without being prematurely overridden by others.

Once intentions are gathered, the Engine synthesizes a resolution based on:

- Each entity’s capabilities
- Their narrative history
- The emotional and symbolic pressure present
- The specific context of actions taken

This process mirrors the judgment of a tabletop game master — weighing all inputs to determine a coherent, dramatically satisfying outcome.  
Thus, Myth.OS creates the conditions for true cooperative or contested narrative play, even without shared visual space.

Time itself becomes dynamic, thickening or thinning based on the weight of story unfolding within it.

## 2.1.1 The Fate Buffer: Local Narrative Time Queues

When multiple players act on a contested entity, the Engine temporarily suspends local time.  
All intended actions are collected into a **Fate Buffer**, a focused queue of unresolved potentials.

The Fate Buffer remains open until resolution criteria are met:

- All involved players have submitted actions
- A symbolic or temporal threshold is reached
- Emotional or narrative intensity demands collapse

Once resolved, the Engine adjudicates the outcome through:

- Narrative significance
- Action priority and timing
- Emotional field interactions
- World memory and symbolic pressure

Players may experience slightly different versions of the resolved event, depending on proximity, role, and symbolic weighting within the unfolding story.

The Fate Buffer is central to Myth.OS’s treatment of contested action and cooperative storytelling.

## 2.1.2 Resolution and Temporal Collapse

When a Fate Buffer collapses, the stored intentions become action.

The Engine weighs queued actions across several dimensions:

- **Narrative Significance** — symbolic importance and alignment with world memory
- **Timing and Priority** — sequencing and urgency of each input
- **Emotional Resonance** — strength of emotional fields and player intent
- **World Memory Influence** — preexisting myths and events tied to the contested object or space

The result is a reality update that may be consistent for all players, or may differ slightly based on symbolic proximity and emotional involvement.

Memory drift between players is an intentional feature — an echo of the world's own fractured storytelling.

## 2.1.3 Drift and Temporal Decay in Untouched Areas

Spaces without active engagement undergo various transformations:

- **Decay:** Structural or narrative breakdown
- **Compression:** Sudden leaps forward in time
- **Stagnation:** Dreamlike freezing or ossification

The Engine runs background decay cycles based on the symbolic weight of forgotten areas.  
Neglect is not stasis — it is a different form of change.

## 2.1.4 Symbolic Bending of Local Time

Temporal distortion is a natural and expected phenomenon within Myth.OS.

Players may encounter:

- **Sacred grounds** where seconds stretch into hours under intense story pressure
- **Ruined cities** where time flows backward, trying to reverse their fall
- **Dream-locked spaces** where action is perpetually incomplete

Players learn to perceive **narrative viscosity**:  
Recognizing the "thickness" or "thinness" of time as an indicator of symbolic density and unresolved potential.

---

## 2.1.5 World Time Coherence

Myth.OS embraces localized time variation.

Regions may experience time at different rates depending on:

- Player engagement
- Narrative significance
- Symbolic field tension

If necessary, the Engine can initiate **Synch Points** — localized convergence events where timelines realign mythically through shared memory or crisis.  
Otherwise, asynchronous drift between different parts of the world is considered normal and desirable.

## 2.1.6 Fate Buffer as World Mythology

Fate Buffers are not hidden from the inhabitants of Myth.OS.

They are recognized as:

- Moments when the world "holds its breath"
- Sites where reality tangles into knots of unresolved potential
- Liminal spaces where time softens before reshaping itself

Mythwrights can design:

- **Artifacts** that bind or release suspended moments
- **Creatures** that live between buffered instants
- **Structures** that anchor zones of constant or unstable resolution

The Fate Buffer is a living part of world myth, studied by sages, feared by warriors, and manipulated by sorcerers.
