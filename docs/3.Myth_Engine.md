## 3.1 Myth Engine

The Myth Engine is the central interpreter of the Myth.OS system ‚Äî the mechanism by which symbolic data is made meaningful. It governs narrative timing, evaluates player input, modulates emotional geography, and enforces the logic of recursive world evolution.

The engine is not a physics simulator. It is a mythic evaluator ‚Äî a system that determines what ‚Äúmakes sense‚Äù in context, not what is physically accurate. This distinction is critical. The Myth Engine privileges symbolic causality, narrative weight, emotional charge, and collective expectation over material realism.

### Responsibilities

The Myth Engine is responsible for the following core functions:

- **Narrative Timing:** Determines when world updates occur based on attention, tension, and story pressure.
- **Command Evaluation:** Parses incoming player language and attempts to evaluate its effects using available context and narrative probability.
- **State Mutation:** Updates the symbolic and spatial state of the world in response to interpreted actions.
- **Emotional Modulation:** Adjusts the Vexotra profile of a location, object, or being based on events, words, or rituals.
- **Memory Integration:** Queries and updates persistent memory structures across both Round and Mythic layers.
- **Coherence Enforcement:** Prevents dissonant outputs by grounding generation in previously declared facts, symbolic tension, and narrative plausibility.

### Engine Loop

Each player action initiates a cycle through the following stages:

1. **Ingestion**: Player input is passed to the engine as free-form natural language.
2. **Parsing**: A parser interprets the intent, seeking matching or related entries in the YAML world state.
3. **Context Assembly**: Relevant data is assembled ‚Äî physical surroundings, symbolic properties, emotional fields, recent memory, and other local context.
4. **Narrative Evaluation**: The engine forwards this context, along with the parsed action, to the LLM for interpretive synthesis.
5. **Output Judgment**: The output is parsed and evaluated:
   - Does it align with known world rules?
   - Is it plausible given past events and emotional state?
   - Does it create symbolic tension or advance narrative arcs?
6. **Mutation**: If approved, world state is mutated accordingly. This may include changing Vexotra values, marking objects as transformed, shifting character locations, etc.
7. **Broadcast**: Resulting descriptions are distributed to relevant players or areas.

### Symbolic Authority

The Myth Engine serves as a gatekeeper of plausibility. It must resolve ambiguous or novel input not by checking a physics engine, but by asking a different question:

> ‚ÄúHave we seen this in story before?‚Äù

For instance, if a player attempts to climb a wall of ivy, the engine will not simulate weight and grip. It will instead query:

- Is climbing ivy something that typically succeeds in stories?
- Has the player done something mythically significant to justify success?
- What mood does the ivy carry? (e.g., a Vexotra field of sadness might resist intrusion)

From this, it draws a decision ‚Äî not ‚Äútrue/false‚Äù in a mechanical sense, but narratively valid or invalid.

### Mythic Pattern Recognition

This is the Myth Engine‚Äôs greatest strength over conventional engines. It does not need hard-coded mechanics for every interaction. Instead, it leverages its LLM backend to evaluate:

- Common outcomes of similar actions in the mythic corpus (training data)
- Symbolic implications of the act (e.g., destroying a mirror = breaking illusion)
- Current emotional and historical tension in the location
- Player‚Äôs narrative arc so far (e.g., are they due a reversal?)

It acts as both function dispatcher and oracle, making decisions that are true within the world not because of physics, but because of myth.

### Error and Reconciliation

Sometimes the LLM will hallucinate or suggest an outcome incompatible with world state. The Myth Engine is equipped to:

- Reject outputs and retry with clarified prompts
- Flag contradictions for human moderator intervention
- Apply a ‚Äúplausibility filter‚Äù that de-risks uncertain results by softening or deferring action (‚ÄúYou reach for the stars ‚Äî but something stops you‚Ä¶‚Äù)

### Summary

The Myth Engine is not merely a narrative generator. It is a consistency engine, a mythic judge, and a rhythm-keeper. It enables emergent play not by modeling reality, but by interpreting meaning.

It holds the laws of story, the mood of place, and the weight of memory in balance ‚Äî so that any action, no matter how strange, has a place it might land.
# 3.2 Navigator
*Interpreter of the Will*

The Navigator is the component of Myth.OS that translates player input‚Äîtypically expressed in natural language‚Äîinto structured actions within the world model. It acts as the bridge between human expression and system logic, interpreting not only what the player says or types, but what they intend, within the metaphysical rules of the current world.

## Primary Responsibilities

### Intent Parsing
The Navigator processes freeform player input and determines the intended action. For example, the phrase:

> ‚ÄúI slowly lift the glowing orb and whisper to it.‚Äù

might be interpreted as:

```yaml
action: lift
object: glowing_orb
modifiers:
  - speed: slow
  - whisper: true
```

### Layer Resolution
The Navigator determines which layer (Round, Mythic, or both) the action applies to. For instance, "walk north" maps directly to spatial movement (Round), whereas "commune with the shadows" targets Vexotra or mythic layer mechanisms.

### Contextual Validation
The Navigator checks the current world state to confirm if the action is plausible. If a player tries to "climb the ivy," the Navigator queries existing YAML object data:

```yaml
object: ivy
attributes:
  climbable: true
```

If that attribute is missing, the engine may invoke the LLM to infer a likely answer based on narrative plausibility, e.g., "ivy is typically climbable unless otherwise specified."

### Tag Expansion and Symbolic Linking
Input may contain latent symbolic references. For example:

> ‚ÄúI throw the coin into the well and wish‚Äù

could trigger tags like:

```yaml
action: ritual
tags: [currency, hope, well, offering]
consequence: initiate symbolic event or change vexotra fields
```

The Navigator links verbs and nouns to emotional, narrative, and spatial effects.

### Queueing and Scheduling
Parsed actions are packaged into world interaction units and queued for processing by the Myth Engine. Timing is dictated by Narrative Pressure rather than real-time clocks.

## Optional Enhancements

### Player-Defined Syntax
Worlds may allow players to define personal macro-commands or symbolic gestures (e.g., a player can register ‚Äúpray‚Äù to execute a specific ritual gesture and narrative effect).

### Multiple Interpreters
For more complex setups, the Navigator may run multiple interpretation passes‚Äîe.g., first a rule-based interpreter, followed by a narrative classifier, then a symbolic evaluator.

### Mythic Overlays
Some worlds may configure the Navigator to weight symbolic meaning more heavily than physical logic. In these cases, a player speaking the right word in the right emotional context may open a sealed door more effectively than trying to force it open.

### API Schema Example
```
navigator_input:
  player_id: squirrel-193
  input: "I tie the red thread around the door handle and knock three times."

navigator_output:
  action: bind
  object: door_handle
  tool: red_thread
  modifiers:
    - knock_count: 3
  symbolic_tags: [ritual, binding, omen]
  affects_layers:
    - round
    - mythic
  result:
    status: queued
    next_pass: myth_engine
    potential_outcome: ["door opens on third knock", "a presence becomes aware"]

```## 3.3 Memory System  
**Persistent Symbolic State Infrastructure**

The Memory System is the YAML-based world state archive and mutation layer. It defines how the world‚Äôs structure and narrative history persist, evolve, and decay across sessions. It also governs how player input results in permanent change to the symbolic terrain of the world, using LLM inference to translate narrative commands into structured edits.

---

### ‚úÖ Core Mechanics

**Primary Format**: All entities and world regions are stored as discrete `.yaml` files. Each file contains a unique `id`, and is updated independently by the engine.

**Storage Structure**:
```csharp
world/
  objects/        ‚Üí individual YAML files for items, terrain, etc.
  npcs/           ‚Üí characters and agents
  players/        ‚Üí persistent player data and trace records
  vexotra/        ‚Üí evolving emotional topography
  logs/           ‚Üí timestamped event traces
```

**Write Cycle**:
- On mutation: the Myth Engine queues a structured edit.
- On tick: all queued edits are flushed to disk with `timestamp_modified` and a `diff_hash`.
- Optional: journaling mode appends every change to `logs/history.yaml`.

---

### üîÑ Command ‚Üí YAML Mutation

When a player performs an action (e.g., *I feed the flame with a poem I wrote in prison*), the system follows a structured interpretation path:

1. **Locate Context**  
   The engine identifies the player's current location.  
   All loaded YAML files within scope (e.g., nearby objects, local NPCs, current room) are cached.

2. **Compare Input to Known Entities**  
   The LLM scans the input for verbs, objects, modifiers, and symbolic roles.  
   It attempts to match them to existing YAML objects or attributes (e.g., `flame`, `poem`, `feed`).

3. **Evaluate Missing Data**  
   If no object is tagged as `feedable`, the LLM is asked:  
   _"Is a flame something that can be fed a poem?"_  
   The LLM returns `likely`, `uncertain`, or `unlikely`, optionally with justification.  
   If `likely`, the engine proceeds with generating a diff.

4. **Compile Mutation Plan**  
```yaml
edit:
  target: flame
  mutation:
    actions:
      - receive_offering: poem
    tags_added: [ritual, transformation]
    vexotra_profile:
      wonder: +0.3
      sorrow: +0.1
```
If necessary, new objects are created (e.g., a `poem` object with a `backstory` tag).

5. **Submit to Myth Engine**  
   All edits are validated and queued for write-back on the next narrative tick.

---

### ‚è≥ Time and Decay

**Timestamping**  
All mutable entities include:
```yaml
created_at: 2025-04-30T16:02:00Z
last_updated: 2025-05-01T02:15:30Z
last_accessed: 2025-05-01T02:15:30Z
narrative_tick: 835
```

**Memory Reinforcement**  
Entities track a `memory_strength` float (default: `1.0`).  
Accessing or acting on an object reinforces it.  
Forgotten elements fade from the world unless re-invoked.

**Decay Model**:
```yaml
decay:
  half_life_ticks: 500
  decay_function: exponential
  decay_fields: [memory_strength, vexotra_profile]
```
Below a threshold (e.g., `0.05`), objects are flagged for deletion or mythic regeneration.

---

### üîÅ Regeneration

Forgotten entities may re-emerge if:
- A player remembers them by name or function.
- A symbolic anchor was previously set (e.g., `symbolic_anchor: true`).
- A strong enough vexotra event ‚Äúcalls‚Äù them back (e.g., a grief spike at the site of a lost love).

The Myth Engine uses fuzzy matching and symbolic pattern recognition to determine if revival is warranted.

---

### üß† Player Traces

Each player maintains a personal memory trace YAML:
```yaml
player_memory:
  visited_locations:
    - altar_of_fog
    - subway_station_13
  remembered_npcs:
    - junk_angel
    - echo_rider
  emotional_imprints:
    altar_of_fog:
      grief: 0.8
      wonder: 0.4
```

This trace shapes:
- Personalized hallucinations or echoes
- NPC recognition or surprise
- Potential resurrection of decayed content

Player memory decay is optional and tunable via `eth.os`.

---

### üß† Mythic Advantage of LLM Integration

Unlike static game engines, Myth.OS does not rely on pre-scripted logic trees.  
The LLM's ability to infer likely outcomes from human experience allows for:

- Flexible command interpretation  
  (e.g., ‚Äúoffer blood to the stone‚Äù vs ‚Äútouch the stone with reverence‚Äù)  
- Narrative plausibility checks without hardcoding rules for every object  
- Symbolic extrapolation  
  (e.g., connecting ‚Äúthrowing a coin in‚Äù with ritual, hope, chance)

It draws on the entire mythic corpus of human writing‚Äînot just fantasy tropes, but noir, memoir, folklore, and cultural pattern‚Äîmaking Myth.OS a living world engine that understands story because it was trained on stories.

# 3.4 Schema Specification

Myth.OS uses structured YAML schemas to define all in-world entities‚Äîobjects, locations, beings, forces, and layers of reality. These schemas provide a common interface between the world‚Äôs narrative fabric and the Myth Engine‚Äôs interpretive machinery.

This specification does **not enforce a universal structure** for all worlds. Instead, it outlines the minimal expectations for interoperability and the patterns that enable flexible, symbolic, and emergent gameplay.

## üß≠ Purpose

Schemas in Myth.OS describe the **shape and behavior of world elements**. They are not hardcoded blueprints, but rather living descriptions the engine interprets in context. Myth.OS is designed to accommodate a wide variety of schema designs while offering guidance on patterns that support deep interaction, evolution, and symbolic processing.

The engine does not validate schemas strictly. Instead, it reads them as layered invitations to meaning‚Äîresponding to defined fields, interpreting unexpected ones, and mutating them over time.

## üîí Required Fields

To ensure minimum functionality across all entity types, only two fields are **engine-critical**:

- `id`: a unique internal identifier (e.g., `"glowing-brick"`, `"tundra-cabin"`).
- `type`: the declared object type (e.g., `"thing"`, `"creature"`, `"location"`), which must match the schema it belongs to.

These are the only required fields across all current schema types. Everything else‚Äînames, descriptions, behaviors, states‚Äîis optional, though highly recommended for narrative clarity and player immersion.

## üîì Extensibility

All Myth.OS schemas support wildcard extensions via `[ * ]` blocks. This means developers are free to define new fields without engine modification. Myth.OS is designed to interpret these additions in context, applying them symbolically or storing them for later resolution.

This open structure encourages experimentation. You might add:
- `ritual_triggers`
- `dream_state`
- `alignment`
- `mutation_vector`

Each will be parsed within the entity‚Äôs narrative and symbolic environment, allowing for organic emergence rather than static validation.

## üåÄ Emotional Overlays

Most schema types support `vexotra_overlays`, a dynamic system for emotional transformation. These overlays define how an entity‚Äôs description, appearance, or behavior shifts in response to the player's current emotional vector. They are keyed to named axes (e.g., `sorrow`, `wrath`, `absurdity`) defined elsewhere in the world configuration.

While not required, vexotra overlays provide a powerful mechanism for responsive storytelling and symbolic world mutation.

## üß¨ Optional Profiles

Some entity types define nested profiles for behavior and metaphysical state:

- `entity_profile` (used in `location`, `beast`) describes things like species, sentience, or dream cycles.
- `state_profile` (used in `thing`) handles flags like `is_portable`, `is_alive`, or `is_container`.

These are world-convenient structures‚Äînot engine demands.

## üåç World-Specific Patterns

Certain schemas (notably `location` and `beast`) incorporate anatomical or system-based symbolism (e.g., `"gut"`, `"civic-neural"`). These are **not required or universal**, but reflect specific design choices in the world of Urfth. Myth.OS itself remains agnostic, and such metaphors may be freely swapped, extended, or ignored.

## üìÅ Example Schemas

Canonical schemas are maintained in separate files:
- `deity.schema.yml`
- `beast.schema.yml`
- `location.schema.yml`
- `things.schema.yml`
- `layers.schema.yml`

These serve as reference models. Each project is expected to evolve or override these templates according to its metaphysical structure and narrative goals.
## 3.5 World Configuration (`eth.os/`)

Each Myth.OS world includes a root configuration folder‚Äîcommonly named `eth.os/`‚Äîwhich defines both the technical structure and the philosophical intent of the world. This directory is not just a bundle of settings. It is the living charter of the world‚Äôs logic, mood, emotional structure, narrative affordances, and mythic constraints.

It tells the engine not just how to behave, but why‚Äîand what kind of story the world is trying to become.

### Dual Nature of `eth.os`

#### 1. Behavioral Settings

`eth.os/` provides configuration parameters that control world mechanics:

* Decay and memory models

* Emotional axes and narrative response logic

* Time tick and narrative stalling

* Default player attributes and sensory radius

* Optional toggles for symbolic behavior or memory persistence

These fields inform the core engine loop and can be referenced in real-time by system daemons, LLM agents, or mutation processes.

#### 2. Narrative Constitution

More importantly, `eth.os/` acts as a philosophical document‚Äîa written declaration of what this world is, how it thinks, what it values, and what stories it wants to tell.

It can include:

* Tone and genre commitments (e.g. grimdark, tragicomic, devotional satire)

* Mythic framing devices or cosmological mappings

* Historical background or founding myths

* Definitions of symbolic laws or magic

* Ritual expectations or player onboarding paths

* Explicit alignment goals (e.g. ‚Äúfavor joy over dread‚Äù)

All engine decisions‚Äîoverlay resolution, narrative branching, entity mutation, emotional interpretation‚Äîshould refer back to `eth.os/` as a guiding frame. It is not decorative; it is canonical.

### Example Configuration Snippet (Abridged)

```yaml
world_id: "urfth"
world_name: "Urfth ‚Äì The Unfolding Tissue"

cosmology: >
  In the DDYD model, cities are vast sentient superorganisms.
  Each neighborhood, alley, and infrastructure node corresponds to an organ in the great body.
  The Tenderloin is the liver. The Port is the mouth. The dance floor is the hypothalamus.

player_defaults:
  base_strength: 5
  inventory_slots: 10
  influence_radius: 3
  onboarding: >
    Character begins as a glowing ball of light with no limbs or speech.
    They must navigate as a ghost through public mythspace until an existing player blesses them,
    at which point they gain a body and are permitted to interact with inanimate matter.

emotional_axes:
  sorrow: {}
  absurdity: {}
  devotion: {}
  wrath: {}

vexotra_rules:
  wrath:
    threshold: 300
    summon: "velth"
    effect: >
      When a player's WRATH score exceeds 300, the deity Velth is invoked and begins
      influencing local overlays and emotional weather.

narrative_time:
  tick_interval: 30
  max_suspension: 300

decay_model:
  memory_half_life: 48
  object_entropy_rate: 0.03

toggles:
  allow_symbolic_override: true
  enable_mutation_logic: true
  remember_dead_players: false
```

This is a very short example. In practice, a full `eth.os/` may contain:

* Dozens of pages of layered symbolic logic

* Ritual templates

* Lists of Impossible Entities

* Canonical world events

* Meta-laws that affect simulation logic

### Expanded Structure: `eth.os/` as a Directory

To support modular logic and meaningful parsing, `eth.os/` is best treated as a structured folder rather than a monolithic file. This allows the engine to reference only the necessary scroll at any given time, improving both performance and clarity.

A canonical `eth.os/` layout might include:

```
eth.os/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ root.yml                  # World name, engine toggles, global IDs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cosmology.yml             # Foundational narrative or symbolic model
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ narrative_time.yml        # Tick rate, max stalling, time flow logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ emotional_axes.yml        # Declared emotion vectors and modifiers
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ vexotra_rules.yml         # Thresholds for summoning, mutation triggers
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ player_progression.yml    # XP thresholds, embodiment rules, leveling paths
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ onboarding.yml            # Ghost-state logic, entry rituals, body acquisition
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ world_history.yml         # Canonical timeline or inherited scars
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ impossible_entities.yml   # Forbidden or paradoxical symbolic beings
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ glossary.yml              # Symbol definitions, metaphors, sacred terminology
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ metabehavior.yml          # Instructions for LLM interpreter behavior
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ schemas/                  # All entity templates for world types
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ thing.schema.yml
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ location.schema.yml
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ beast.schema.yml
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ deity.schema.yml
```
## 3.6 World State (`world_state/`)

The `world_state/` directory stores the live, mutable conditions of the world‚Äîeverything that evolves, decays, grows, or is influenced by player interaction. This layer reflects the moment-to-moment lived reality of the game world.

While `eth.os/` is immutable and declarative, `world_state/` is transient and observational.

However, this state is not written to directly. Instead, all narrative input passes through an intermediate structure: the `event_queue/`.

A typical `world_state/` directory may include:

```
world_state/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ players/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ squirrel-193.yml
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ opossum-007.yml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ locations/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sf_tenderloin.yml
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ port_terminal.yml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ objects/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ staff-emerald.yml
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ nut-017.yml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ overlays/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ mythic_storm.yml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ events/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 2025-05-03T_event-log.yml
```

Each file captures the real-time data for a world entity, often including:

* Current location or containment hierarchy
* Active emotional fields
* Narrative status or symbolic roles
* Mutation state or decay timestamps

### Purpose and Behavior

`world_state/` should not be written to directly during player input. Instead, all narrative actions and symbolic shifts are first logged as intent files in an intermediate queue (e.g. `event_queue/`). These files capture proposed changes, their emotional framing, initiating agent, and context.

At regular intervals‚Äîdefined in `narrative_time.yml`‚Äîan update daemon processes the queued events, interprets them in context (possibly consulting `eth.os/` for symbolic correctness), and then writes the resolved result into `world_state/`.

This modular buffer model enables:

* Contention resolution in multiplayer scenarios
* Symbolic reinterpretation of concurrent actions
* Narrative prioritization based on tone, tension, or agency
* Preservation of ambiguous or failed interactions for later mutation or ghost-trace

Files in `world_state/` are therefore the product of narrative synthesis‚Äînot raw input. They are the stable, accepted truth of the world at a given moment.

### Differences from `eth.os/`

| `eth.os/`                           | `world_state/`                 |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Immutable, foundational             | Mutable, ephemeral             |
| Defines world laws and logic        | Records momentary truth        |
| Not writable during runtime         | Written and updated constantly |
| Philosophical, symbolic, and sacred | Instrumental and observational |

### Update and Mutation Logic

When the LLM or player action triggers change, the engine writes new values to the affected `world_state/` files:

```yaml
# squirrel-193.yml
location: sf_tenderloin
vexotra:
  wrath: 305
inventory:
  - staff-emerald
status:
  embodied: true
```

In tandem, daemons may apply memory decay, symbolic overlay, or emotional diffusion over time.

### Emotional Decay and Narrative Drift

Vexotra values stored in `world_state/` decay according to rates defined in `eth.os/decay_model.yml`. This allows:

* Cooling of wrath over time
* Memory and symbolic imprint fading
* Removal of forgotten or obsolete story elements

### Event Queue Architecture

#### Sample Intent Log Format

Here is a minimal but expressive YAML structure for a single narrative intent log:

```yaml
agent_id: squirrel-193
location: sf_tenderloin
timestamp: 2025-05-03T13:45:00Z
emotional_state:
  sorrow: 2
  wrath: 6
action:
  verb: throw
  object: nut-017
  target: obsidian-door
narrative_frame: >
  The squirrel, trembling with rage, hurls the seed against the ancient volcanic glass.
symbolic_tags:
  - seed-collision
  - wrath-surge
  - noise-potential
```

This schema provides just enough context for the interpreter daemon to:

* Assess emotional triggers
* Perform physics or symbolic validity checks
* Determine whether the action should succeed, mutate, or spawn secondary effects
* Consult `eth.os/` for any deific or ritual thresholds

Once resolved, the engine writes final state changes to `world_state/` and archives the intent log.

Before changes are committed to `world_state/`, they are recorded as intent logs in a separate folder‚Äî`event_queue/`‚Äîwhich acts as a narrative staging ground. This queue captures raw player or daemon-generated actions and stores them as symbolic proposals, subject to contextual review.

```
event_queue/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2025-05-03T13-45_event-log.yml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2025-05-03T13-45_narrative-intent.yml
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pending/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ squirrel_throw.yml
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ opossum_listen.yml
```

Each file may contain:

* Originating agent and timestamp
* Emotional state at the time of action
* Intended action and its target(s)
* Free-text narrative framing
* Optional symbolic tags (ritual, emotion spike, divine threshold)

The engine processes these actions during each `tick_interval`, reviewing them for coherence, contradiction, and symbolic priority. Once resolved, resulting truths are applied to `world_state/`, and the queue entry is archived.

This design:

* Buffers narrative ambiguity and conflict
* Supports multiplayer determinism and fairness
* Enables mythic causality (e.g., delay, ritualization, retroactive events)

### Daemon Behavior

A daemon‚Äîsometimes referred to as the Interpreter Daemon or World Weaver‚Äîis responsible for processing narrative intent logs from the `event_queue/` and synthesizing them into changes in `world_state/`.

This system is deliberately modular and aspirational: the precise definition of daemon behavior and the logic governing narrative ticks are expected to be some of the most challenging and iterative aspects of Myth.OS to design and implement. Their final forms will likely emerge through extensive testing and story-driven tuning rather than being fully specified up front.

#### Core Responsibilities

* **Poll and read** queued narrative intent logs.
* **Reference** eth.os rules and emotional models.
* **Evaluate** emotional resonance, narrative coherence, and symbolic implications.
* **Resolve** conflicts and overlapping actions.
* **Transform** symbolic narrative into valid YAML state updates.
* **Apply** results to `world_state/`.
* **Archive** processed intent logs for audit or mutation.

#### Example Flow

1. At each tick (`tick_interval` defined in `narrative_time.yml`), the daemon pulls a batch of queued events.
2. For each intent log:

   * Extract emotional\_state and symbolic\_tags.
   * Check for deific thresholds or ritual triggers in `vexotra_rules.yml`.
   * Modify or defer the action if it conflicts with concurrent events.
   * Use narrative logic (LLM if applicable) to determine outcome.
   * Emit structured YAML patch to affected `world_state/` file.
3. Write `save_update.yml` snapshot (optional).

#### Narrative Filters and Mutators

Daemons may support plug-in symbolic filters, such as:

* Emotional decay mutators
* Retcon validators
* Overlay generators (e.g. weather systems, curses, divine presence)
* Ritual success/failure handlers

This process is the spine of Myth.OS's narrative execution engine: not simply reacting to input, but interpreting it within a mythic frame.

### Roadmap and Future Considerations

At this stage of development, much of the `world_state/` and `event_queue/` system design remains aspirational and deliberately flexible. While the architecture described here outlines a powerful symbolic engine, its effectiveness will only be proven through live implementation and iterative refinement.

Areas requiring significant testing and adaptation include:

* The complexity of symbolic collision in multiplayer sessions
* Performance and cadence of narrative tick intervals
* Calibration of emotional thresholds and decay mechanics
* Mutation logic fidelity and narrative drift
* LLM reliability when interpreting ambiguous or conflicting narrative input

Initial implementations should be lightweight and modular, emphasizing interpretability over optimization. A local or single-player prototype can help stress-test the core logic before expanding to distributed, multiplayer, or persistent world scenarios.

These tools are not meant to provide final answers‚Äîthey are scaffolding to help the world find its own symbolic voice.

---

### Save and Sync

At the end of a session, a `save_update.yml` file may be generated to log all changes. This can be versioned or diffed to support:

* Rewind and rollback
* Narrative divergence forks
* Player-specific memories or continuity in multiplayer

The `world_state/` is the live skin of the world. Mutable, fragile, and ever-shifting‚Äîit is the counterpoint to `eth.os/`'s sacred bones.
## 3.7 Overlays (`overlays/`)

Overlays are temporary, symbolic, or metaphysical layers that sit atop the stable `world_state/`. They modulate perception, emotion, and behavior in localized regions of the world without directly altering the underlying entities themselves.

Where `world_state/` defines what _is_, overlays define what _seems_, _feels_, or _shifts_ in symbolic space.

### Purpose and Role

Overlays serve as dynamic narrative modifiers. They are how Myth.OS manifests:

* **Mythic Weather** ‚Äî "A fog of forgetting hangs over the docks."

* **Emotional Fields** ‚Äî "This tunnel seethes with latent wrath."

* **Divine or Anomalous Presence** ‚Äî "Velth stirs in the ruins."

* **Localized Reality Rules** ‚Äî "In this valley, no name can be spoken aloud."

* **Temporal Anomalies** ‚Äî "Time loops in a spiral near the collapsed shrine."

Overlays do not overwrite `world_state/` directly. Instead, they are consulted at runtime by:

* LLM interpreters

* Symbolic daemons

* Emotion processors

* Player interaction parsers

### Structure and Scope

Overlays are stored in a dedicated folder:

```
overlays/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ wrath_field.yml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ silence_zone.yml
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ divine_fog.yml
```

Each overlay typically includes:

```yaml
id: divine_fog
location: sf_tenderloin
radius: 3
emotional_shift:
  sorrow: +12
  absurdity: +8
affects:
  - perception
  - speech
  - memory
rules:
  suppress_communication: true
  timeflow_modifier: 0.8
narrative_description: >
  A pale fog ripples across the district, muting sound and blurring thought.
  Names fall apart before they reach your tongue.
```

### Interaction and Resolution

* Overlays may be activated by events (e.g. high vexotra levels).

* They may decay, move, or evolve based on narrative triggers.

* Multiple overlays can stack. Conflict resolution follows symbolic priority (often defined in `eth.os/`).

* Overlay effects are interpreted rather than enforced‚Äîthey guide narrative outcomes, not hard system logic.

### Overlays vs Structural Layers

Overlays should not be confused with the metaphysical **layers** of a Myth.OS world‚Äîsuch as the Round Layer (physical), the Mythic Layer (symbolic), or the Vexotra Layer (emotional). Those layers form the deep substrate of reality, whereas overlays act as **localized filters** that modify how those layers are expressed or interpreted in specific regions.

An overlay might:

* Suppress Vexotra effects in a holy sanctuary

* Amplify Mythic Layer symbolism during a storm

* Obscure the Round Layer‚Äôs clarity with hallucinatory mist

Importantly, overlays do not have to be purely symbolic or metaphysical. They can represent **literal environmental conditions** such as:

* Pollution drifting across a landscape

* Rain or fog reducing visibility

* Swamps altering movement and mood

Thus, overlays are not themselves layers‚Äîthey are **temporary alterations to how layers manifest** in narrative or physical space.

### Creation and Mutation

Overlays can be:

* Declared statically in `eth.os/`

* Generated dynamically by daemons

* Summoned by deities or player rituals

* Spawned by emotional thresholds (e.g. wrath > 300)

### Example Use Cases

* A ritual summons a storm of laughter, disarming all aggression in the area.

* A failed memory check spawns a "forgetting field" around an NPC.

* An area cursed with "reverse causality" makes future actions rewrite the past.

Overlays represent the expressive soul of the engine‚Äîneither permanent nor arbitrary, they are the breath between myth and system.
