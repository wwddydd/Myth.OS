# 2.1 Narrative Time

---

## 2.1.0 Time as a Product of Narrative Density and Pressure

Multiplayer interaction in text-based environments presents a unique challenge.  
In visual games, players can track events through movement, animations, and environmental cues.  
In a purely text-driven world, however, timing, intention, and action must be interpreted entirely through language alone.  
Traditional engines struggle to keep group action coherent because they rely on rigid preprogramming that cannot easily adapt to fluid cooperation.

Myth.OS addresses this with the **Narrative Time Constant**: a living system that adapts to the flow of interaction.  
When multiple players engage within the same region or upon the same object, the engine slows local time.  
This creates a moment for participants to submit their intentions, much like a tabletop game master calling for declarations before resolving a chaotic scene.

Once collected, these intentions are resolved based on each participant's abilities, histories, emotional presence, and the symbolic weight of their actions.  
Time itself bends to accommodate meaning: thickening where attention gathers, thinning where memory fades.

Thus, Myth.OS builds a foundation where cooperation, conflict, and collective storymaking are not only possible but natural — even in a world made entirely of words.

---

## 2.1.1 The Fate Buffer: Local Narrative Time Queues

When multiple players act simultaneously on a contested target — an object, location, or entity — the world does not immediately respond.  
Instead, the Engine suspends local time, gathering all submitted intentions into a **Fate Buffer**.

The Buffer waits, allowing every involved participant a chance to act.  
It may collapse when:

- All players involved have acted
- A symbolic time threshold passes
- Narrative tension reaches a breaking point

Once collapse is triggered, the Engine resolves the buffered actions based on narrative strength, emotional resonance, action timing, and ties to the world's memory.

Importantly, resolution may differ slightly across participants.  
Proximity to the event, emotional entanglement, and narrative positioning all influence individual experience.

The Fate Buffer is not an exception — it is the core method Myth.OS uses to manage contested moments of shared reality.

---

## 2.1.2 Resolution and Temporal Collapse

The collapse of a Fate Buffer is the moment possibility becomes history.

The Engine evaluates all stored actions across several dimensions:

- **Narrative Significance:** How symbolically or emotionally important an action is within the current world state
- **Timing and Priority:** When actions were taken relative to others, and how assertively
- **Emotional Resonance:** The strength of emotional fields surrounding players and events
- **World Memory Influence:** How much the space or object already carries historical or mythic weight

The Engine synthesizes these factors into a reality update.  
Some players may see consistent results; others, depending on their symbolic closeness, may perceive variations.  
This divergence is not an error — it reflects the fractured nature of memory and the world's layered reality.

---

## 2.1.3 Drift and Temporal Decay in Untouched Areas

Areas without player engagement do not remain unchanged.

Forgotten places drift, decay, or mutate according to their symbolic inertia:

- **Decay** leads to structural collapse or loss of coherence.
- **Compression** allows years to pass in the space of a moment.
- **Stagnation** freezes regions into inert, dreamlike states.

The Engine maintains these changes through background decay cycles, modulating them based on how much weight the location still carries.  
Neglect is itself a form of transformation — slow, patient, inevitable.

---

## 2.1.4 Symbolic Bending of Local Time

Time bends visibly across Myth.OS.

Players may find:

- **Sacred grounds** where moments stretch endlessly under the weight of expectation
- **Ruined cities** where time loops backward, desperately trying to undo catastrophe
- **Dream-locked regions** where action freezes, stories refusing to conclude

Narrative viscosity — the thickness or thinness of time — becomes another sense players learn to read, guiding them toward places heavy with story or away from barren stretches of forgotten ground.

---

## 2.1.5 World Time Coherence

Myth.OS does not enforce a universal timeline.  
Regions operate at different temporal speeds, dictated by the flow of story and emotional density.

Players in separate areas may experience days, months, or minutes at wildly different rates.  
Shared events, symbolic crises, or narrative convergence points can realign timelines when needed, creating mythic synchronicity.

In the absence of convergence, divergence is natural.  
The world's timeline is a living braid, not a fixed rail.

---

## 2.1.6 Fate Buffer as World Mythology

The inhabitants of Myth.OS recognize the effects of the Fate Buffer, even if they name it differently.

They speak of:

- The world catching its breath before great change
- Fate tangling into knots too heavy for ordinary time to bear
- Liminal moments where reality itself softens and waits

Mythwrights may create artifacts that interact with these moments:

- Devices that delay or hasten suspended time
- Creatures that only exist between buffered instants
- Structures that stabilize or destabilize zones of unresolved action

The Fate Buffer is woven into the myths, fears, and ambitions of the world’s people.  
It is not merely a mechanic; it is part of reality’s architecture.

# 2.1.7 Fate Buffer Interrupt Mechanics 

---

## Concept Overview

Normally, a Fate Buffer collects intentions and resolves them in a structured collapse.  
However, under certain conditions, external forces or destabilizing factors can *interrupt* an active Fate Buffer before normal resolution occurs.

These are known as **Fate Buffer Interrupts**.

---

## Causes of Interrupt

- **New Entrants:** New players or entities entering the contested space mid-buffer.
- **World Events:** Environmental or narrative shocks (earthquakes, invasions, storms) that impose higher-priority changes.
- **Artifacts or Spells:** Special items or effects that deliberately rupture suspended moments.
- **Decay Breach:** Symbolic infrastructure underpinning the buffer weakens due to neglect, corruption, or overload.

---

## Effects of Interrupt

- Collected intentions may be voided, scrambled, or forcibly reinterpreted.
- Immediate partial resolutions may occur, with new secondary Fate Buffers forming.
- Players may experience fractured memories or diverging versions of the same event.
- World memory may encode multiple competing historical accounts of the event.

---

## Mythological Framing

- Described in-world as:
  - "Tearing the Veil of Potential"
  - "Fate Snarlings"
  - "Premature Births of Possibility"
- Mythwrights may create artifacts to either stabilize against or intentionally cause Interrupts.

---

## Mechanical Purpose

- Preserves the sense that even suspended moments are alive and vulnerable.
- Introduces chaos and counterplay options for players.
- Adds depth to narrative worldbuilding for settings that include time manipulation, symbolic warfare, or reality disruption.

---

## Current Status

- **Not core to baseline Myth.OS operation.**
- **Reserved for worlds/settings that explicitly support meta-engine physics (e.g., time magic, chaos entities, destabilized symbolic fields).**
- **Candidate for optional module or advanced Mythwright crafting guide.**# 2.2 World Memory and Persistence

---

## 2.2.0 Memory as Substance

In Myth.OS, world memory is an active data structure that records, modifies, and resolves the state of the world across time.  
All persistent objects, regions, events, and entities are defined by their entries in the memory system.

World memory is stored in **structured YAML files**, automatically generated and updated by the Engine. These files evolve dynamically based on player interaction, environmental change, and symbolic events.

Memory entries may include:

- **Spatial data:** location coordinates, attachment hierarchies, bounding vectors  
- **Symbolic tags:** emotional fields, alignment history, ritual state  
- **Interaction logs:** recent changes, timestamps, and narrative flags

Schema are **flexible but scheme-directed**. The Engine uses predefined object schemes and modifies or extends them as needed. New memory entries are initialized from the most appropriate scheme based on interaction context, object type, or world-specific logic.

Memory is not limited to major structures. If configured accordingly, the system can track and store:

- Named pebbles, individual tree branches, fragments of broken items  
- Shifting water levels, weather cycles, ambient sounds  
- NPC moods, task states, and location trails

---

## 2.2.1 Accumulation, Drift, and Forgetting

When a player or agent interacts with a part of the world, the Engine records the event in that entity’s memory file.

Each interaction increases the **memory density** of the target, measured by frequency, emotional intensity, and narrative weight.  
As density increases, the Engine may:

- Refine the schema with new fields  
- Anchor symbolic states as persistent properties  
- Flag the object or area as “stabilized”

Memory decay occurs in the absence of interaction.

The Engine performs routine evaluations (e.g., during Midnight Cycle passes) to determine which elements should enter **drift**:

- Low-density memory regions may begin symbolic mutation  
- Structural data may be compressed, generalized, or removed  
- High-entropy zones may develop new traits, identities, or behavior patterns

This mechanism ensures that the memory footprint of the world remains scalable while enabling transformation over time.

---

## 2.2.2 Dynamic Reinforcement and Density Scaling

The Engine uses interaction data to adjust **granularity** of memory per region or object.

High-density memory zones receive:

- Full object schema with fine-grained fields  
- Long-term change logs  
- Cross-referenced entries in the world memory graph

Low-density or recently created zones may receive:

- Compressed schema  
- Procedural regeneration templates  
- Metadata-only summaries

This allows Myth.OS to support both minimal memory worlds and high-fidelity symbolic environments, depending on builder preference and player activity.

Builders can configure density thresholds in ETH.os to specify:

- Maximum object resolution  
- Criteria for compression  
- Rules for automatic archival or deletion

---

## 2.2.3 Fault Line Drift Mechanics

When symbolic or structural decay reaches a threshold, the Engine uses **fault line logic** to determine mutation pathways.

Fault lines are defined by:

- Surviving **symbolic tags** (e.g., betrayal, serenity, vigilance)  
- Spatial **memory vectors** (walls, road directions, elevation contours)  
- Stored **narrative flags** (e.g., region burned in war, site of great sorrow)

Drifted objects and regions will mutate along these vectors. For example:

- A ruined fortress associated with rage may become a volcanic crater  
- A decayed garden touched by grief may evolve into a dreamlike tomb  
- Structural features may persist symbolically: steps remembered as thresholds, doors as barriers

Fault line drift allows decayed memory to produce **meaningful transformations** without requiring full retention or design intervention.

---

## 2.2.4 Stable vs Decaying World Modes (ETH.os Parameters)

Each world defines its memory behavior through **ETH.os** — the world’s configuration file.

Key parameters include:

- `memory_mode: stable | decaying`  
- `prune_threshold: <float>` — decay triggers below this density  
- `preservation_zones: [region_id...]` — regions immune to decay  
- `max_schema_depth: <int>` — limits object complexity for scaling

**Stable Mode**:
- Memory is retained indefinitely unless manually deleted or force-pruned  
- Encourages detailed, persistent worlds with long-term historical layering  
- Suitable for simulationist or narrative-heavy settings

**Decaying Mode**:
- Unused or low-weight memory is compressed or discarded on schedule  
- Promotes symbolic transformation and dynamic regeneration  
- Supports dreamlike or mythic settings where change is expected

ETH.os may also define hybrid behaviors such as seasonal decay, entropy acceleration, or decay inversion (where frequent interaction causes instability).

---

## 2.2.5 Example Schema: `thing`

The Myth.OS Engine maintains world memory by instantiating object data from YAML-based schema. One core example is the **`thing`** schema, used to represent all interactable entities that are not strictly locations or creatures.

A `thing` can include:

- Physical items (e.g. tools, relics, debris)  
- Symbolic constructs (e.g. a curse, a fragmented memory)  
- Environmental details (e.g. furniture, signs, animated architecture)

### Key fields include:

- **`id`, `name`, and `description`** — human-readable and system-resolved identifiers  
- **`state_profile`** — properties such as `is_portable`, `is_container`, `is_alive`, or `is_bound`  
- **`symbolic_roles`** — defines narrative roles such as “key,” “threshold,” “anchor,” or “witness”  
- **`behavior` and `effects`** — trigger conditions and symbolic affordances  
- **`vexotra_overlays`** — conditional transformations based on emotional alignment vectors

Objects defined with this schema adapt based on player interaction and symbolic alignment.  
For example, if a player enters a sorrow-heavy state, an otherwise inert “stone bench” may gain a new description, emit a ghostly light, or unlock a hidden behavior path.

The `thing` schema illustrates several architectural principles of Myth.OS memory:

- **Schema-driven YAML** enables formalized, extensible object definitions  
- **Symbolic overlays** allow responsive changes without duplicating the base object  
- **Emotional state + memory context** shapes gameplay as much as mechanical state

Builders may subclass `thing` or define specialized symbolic tags relevant to their world logic.  
The Engine interprets extensions dynamically based on world configuration and player context.

---

## 2.2.6 Timestamping and Memory History

Myth.OS supports timestamping for both object interactions and memory state changes.  
This data is used for:

- Decay logic  
- Replay or inspection of narrative drift  
- Symbolic event tracking  
- Temporal anomaly detection or design

### Interaction Timestamps

By default, the Engine appends a `last_interacted` field to any object, region, or entity with persistent memory:

```yaml
last_interacted: 2087-04-17T13:55:02Z
```

Builders can configure:

- Timezone and format (UTC recommended for engine consistency)  
- Maximum retention duration  
- Whether timestamps affect pruning thresholds

---

### Version History and Symbolic Drift Logs

Objects may optionally store historical state changes using a versioned history log.  
This can be used for debugging, archival, or mythic storytelling.

```yaml
history:
  - time: 2083-03-21T00:00:00Z
    state:
      name: "Saria"
      role: "oracle"
      temperament: "kind"

  - time: 2086-11-10T00:00:00Z
    state:
      name: "Saria"
      role: "fallen oracle"
      temperament: "wrathful"
```

This history may be:

- Manually defined (by Builders)  
- Dynamically generated (by Engine policy)  
- Capped by count, age, or symbolic resolution (e.g., retain only events flagged as significant)

---

## 2.2.7 Memory Scope and Access Models

Myth.OS supports multiple memory scope configurations that define how world memory is accessed and shared among players.  
These scopes allow builders to control the visibility, divergence, and symbolic gating of persistent world data.

Memory scope is defined per object, location, region, or NPC. It can be explicitly declared in YAML or inferred by Engine rule.

---

### Scope Types

#### **Global**
All players share a single version of memory.  
When a change occurs (e.g. a town burns down), it is visible to all players immediately or at next world update.

```yaml
memory_scope: global
```

---

#### **Personal**
Each player (or party/faction) maintains a private copy of the object’s memory state.  
Changes are local until the Engine or a builder event reconciles or merges them.

Useful for:
- Dreams and hallucinations  
- Personal quests  
- Psychological distortions  
- Private hauntings

```yaml
memory_scope:
  type: personal
  key: player_id
```

---

#### **Conditional**
Memory exists in full, but visibility or access is gated by a symbolic or narrative condition.  
The object may appear differently depending on the viewer’s emotional state, alignment, class, or past actions.

```yaml
memory_scope:
  type: conditional
  condition: has_tag("reckoned_with_guilt")
```

---

### Use Cases

- A player sees a burned city only after visiting in person  
- A curse manifests only for characters aligned with fear  
- An NPC remembers a betrayal differently for each party involved  
- A god’s memory of a player diverges based on offerings or dreams

---

### Engine Considerations

- Personal and conditional scopes increase memory complexity  
- Builders should define reconciliation logic or use scheduled merges  
- Scoped memory should be used sparingly in high-traffic areas unless symbolic divergence is desired

---

Memory scope allows the world to maintain both canonical state and subjective experience — enabling fractured realities, layered truths, and player-specific world memory without breaking core coherence.# 2.3 Round and Mythic Worlds

---

## 2.3.0 Dual-Layer Model

Myth.OS operates on a two-layer spatial architecture, combining coordinate-based physical space with a symbolic emotional topology. These are known as the:

- Round Layer — defines measurable, navigable physical geography  
- Mythic Layer — defines symbolic resonance, emotional weight, and narrative state

Both layers are always present. They may be aligned, divergent, or partially overlapping, depending on the current narrative and emotional conditions of the world.

The Engine interprets player actions, world memory, and object context based on data from both layers. Interactions may occur in one layer, the other, or across both simultaneously.

---

## 2.3.1 Round Layer: Coordinate-Based World Geometry

The Round Layer forms the physical structure of the world. It defines where things are, how far apart they are, and what occupies which location.

By default, all world objects are placed using latitude, longitude, and elevation, scaled to Earth’s surface:

- Latitude and longitude are stored as floating-point values  
- Elevation is recorded in meters or a configured local unit  
- The system supports spherical projection, including longitudinal compression near poles

This coordinate format allows the Engine to support:

- Geometric scaling and proximity queries  
- Distance-aware navigation systems  
- Procedural terrain generation  
- Direct import of external geographic data

Spatial datasets from public sources — including ArcGIS, OpenStreetMap, USGS, and others — may be transformed and ingested. Coordinate data is read directly from geometry fields (e.g., GeoJSON) and converted into Myth.OS world objects or region definitions.

World builders may define regions numerically, symbolically, or both. A coastline may be placed using imported contour data, while a shrine may exist only as a single floating point coordinate with attached symbolic tags.

Graphical visualization is not required for navigation or interaction. Myth.OS prioritizes numeric precision, allowing symbolic interactions to operate independently of any visible map.

### Coordinate Embedding and Object Storage

Coordinate data is stored directly within the YAML files of game objects.  
A mountain, structure, or symbolic region may use the thing schema and define coords, elevation, and optionally a shape field to describe its geometry.

Most in-game objects — such as inventory items, creatures, or temporary constructs — are defined with only a coords field and treated as point features.

Geometry is optional but supported for any object requiring area, volume, or symbolic shape awareness.

### Locational Daemons and Proximity Filtering

To avoid scanning every object in the world on every interaction, Myth.OS uses locational daemons — lightweight, per-player or per-region spatial filters that manage real-time proximity awareness.

Each daemon is instantiated based on:

- The player or region’s current coordinates  
- Their sensory or symbolic radius  
- The current active layer (Round or Mythic)

The daemon references a centralized coordinate index (pre-built at world launch or during midnight processing) and caches a filtered list of nearby objects, effects, and overlays.

It answers questions like:

- What can the player currently perceive?  
- What objects are in interaction range?  
- Which regions are mythically aligned?

Objects listed in the daemon may be:

- Fetched by ID and loaded into memory for rendering, narration, or symbolic evaluation  
- Filtered further based on emotional fields, phase alignment, or story state

Daemon state is updated when:

- A player moves outside their current cache radius  
- A memory or layer shift alters the local symbolic landscape  
- World memory is modified in this radius by another actor or event

This allows Myth.OS to maintain fast, player-local spatial awareness without scanning global memory. It also supports hallucination, ritual blindness, and symbolic delusion through controlled daemon drift or divergence.

---

## 2.3.2 Mythic Layer: Symbolic and Emotional Topology

The Mythic Layer overlays the Round Layer but follows a different logic — it is not bound to metric distance or terrain elevation. Instead, it is shaped by:

- Vexotra overlays (emotional vector fields)  
- Symbolic tags on objects, regions, or events  
- Narrative memory from world state or player history

Mythic topology defines perception, resonance, and narrative possibility. It enables:

- Divergent versions of the same place (e.g., a joyful garden vs. a haunted ruin)  
- Non-Euclidean transitions (e.g., emotional corridors, memory tunnels)  
- Layer-specific visibility or object interaction

Regions may acquire their Mythic form through decay, ritual, or player interaction. Some areas exist only mythically — such as dream realms, god-spaces, or forgotten layers of memory.

---

## 2.3.3 Layer Divergence and Convergence

While most regions begin with aligned Round and Mythic layers, divergence is common.

Examples of divergence:

- A player enters a region and sees an emotional projection (Mythic) that does not match the physical terrain (Round)  
- A location persists physically, but its symbolic meaning has eroded or shifted

The Engine may cause layer convergence under specific conditions:

- Completion of ritual conditions  
- Alignment of Vexotra thresholds across multiple players  
- Resolution of narrative tension

Layer convergence can trigger major world events:

- A dream becomes real  
- A mythic path appears in the Round world  
- Emotional corruption takes physical form

Builders can script convergence triggers directly, or allow the Engine to decide based on symbolic pressure and memory conditions.

---

## 2.3.4 Perception and Layer Alignment

Each player has an active layer alignment state — determining how they experience the world at a given location.

The Engine uses this state to:

- Filter visible descriptions, NPCs, and interactables  
- Modify exits, pathways, and object behaviors  
- Resolve symbolic interaction in layer-specific ways

For example:

- A cursed statue may appear to one player but not another  
- A path may fork differently depending on the mythic pressure in the region  
- A player in grief may access a sorrow-aligned mythic layer of a location that others cannot see

Builders can specify fixed alignments (e.g., "this space is always mythic") or allow dynamic state determined by narrative actions and emotional overlays.

---

## 2.3.5 Integration with Memory and Emotional Systems

The Mythic Layer is fed by world memory and emotional pressure.

Symbolic drift, narrative imprinting, and Vexotra overlays all affect how the Mythic Layer behaves.

Examples:

- A town with a long history of betrayal may develop a mythic fog or haunted layer  
- An ancient battlefield remembered only in memory may persist mythically, even if the physical terrain has healed  
- A sacred location may gain new mythic weight through repeated player offerings, dreams, or symbolic use

These changes can either remain mythic — purely symbolic — or eventually reshape the Round Layer as well, especially when memory accumulates or layer convergence occurs.

---

## 2.3.6 Builder Controls and Configuration

World builders have direct control over layer behaviors through:

- Layer alignment flags in world files  
- Visibility conditions based on emotional state or ritual progress  
- Crossover rules that define when mythic and round data merge

Builders can define:

- Round-only zones (e.g., pure terrain, technical puzzles)  
- Mythic-only zones (e.g., dreams, memory spaces)  
- Blended zones with dynamic symbolic state

Tools include:

- layer_config.yaml  
- Vexotra field overlays  
- Memory region flags  
- Conditional entry/exit logic

---

## 2.3.7 Optional: Mythic Layer Compression and Lazy Evaluation

For large-scale or low-interaction regions, the Engine may compress or defer mythic layer generation.

Mechanisms include:

- Mythic Fragments: symbolic states reduced to tags or summaries  
- Mythic Seeds: lightweight memory units awaiting reactivation  
- Ghost Layers: cached emotional terrain structures kept offline until symbolic pressure reactivates them

This reduces memory load and unnecessary world processing, while allowing deep symbolic presence when needed.

Builders may configure:

- Mythic activation thresholds  
- Compression policies  
- Expiration windows for unused symbolic data# 2.4 Recursive World Evolution

---

## 2.4.0 Worlds That Change Themselves

Myth.OS worlds are not fixed containers for player activity — they are **recursive symbolic environments**, capable of transforming themselves in response to internal narrative tension.

A world may shift, evolve, collapse, or reconfigure not through scripts or timers, but through the **accumulated symbolic weight** of memory, emotion, and myth.

This evolution can occur:
- In response to player actions  
- Through passive decay or attention starvation  
- By symbolic pressure across emotional fields  
- As part of ritualized or emergent gameplay loops

Worlds are not stories to be played through. **They are organisms made of story.**

---

## 2.4.1 Symbolic Tension and Mutation

When symbolic pressure accumulates beyond a threshold — either in a specific region or within an entity’s memory field — the Engine may trigger mutation.

Sources of symbolic tension include:
- Divergent Vexotra overlays in a single region  
- Conflicting narrative tags on the same structure  
- Emotional fields that lack resolution over time  
- Incongruous memory fragments retained beyond context

When mutation occurs, it may:
- Change a region’s geometry or symbolic function  
- Spawn new mythic constructs (e.g., rage towers, grief-birds)  
- Alter NPC archetypes or behavior loops  
- Transform boundaries between Mythic and Round Layers

Symbolic mutation is not cosmetic. It redefines what a place **is**, not just what it looks like.

---

## 2.4.2 Collapse and Renewal

Regions can **collapse** when memory density drops below a sustainable threshold or when symbolic coherence fails.

Collapse types include:
- **Memory collapse** — the region forgets its own identity  
- **Mythic fold** — the area recedes into dreamspace or archetypal abstraction  
- **Structural inversion** — the region implodes or reverses form

Collapse is not necessarily destruction. It creates opportunity for **renewal**, which may be triggered by:
- Symbolic rituals performed by players  
- Environmental resonance with surviving memory seeds  
- Anima-driven internal processes within the world engine

Rituals are not defined by genre. In a fantasy world, a ritual might be a salt circle and chant. In a noir city, it might be **cleaning your gun while thinking about the case**.  
A ritual is any symbolic action, performed with intention, that **opens a space for narrative change**.

Renewal does not restore the old world. It **grows a new one** from what remains.

---

## 2.4.3 Seed Mechanics and Mythic Regrowth

Collapsed regions, destroyed structures, or faded entities may leave behind **symbolic seeds**.

A seed can be:
- A physical artifact  
- A lingering tag or narrative marker  
- A Vexotra fingerprint in the land  
- A memory shard retained by a character or location

Seeds are **dormant units of world potential**. When activated, a seed may:
- Regrow a region in mythic form  
- Rebirth an NPC in altered archetype  
- Generate quests or phenomena drawn from prior context  
- Serve as a ritual anchor or narrative catalyst

Because objects are ultimately just YAML files, seeds may carry tremendous weight within small in-game forms. A single item — a lock of hair, a melted token — may contain enough metadata to **reconstruct a kingdom**.  

> You fold it, and you can take a whole universe, and put it into a very tiny hit.

Seed activation may be symbolic (e.g., dreaming of the seed, burying it in sacred soil) or procedural (e.g., triggered by time, resonance, or proximity).

---

## 2.4.4 Emotional Resonance Ecosystems

Over time, regions develop **emotional biomes** driven by the dominant symbolic pressure of interactions.

Example biomes:
- A sorrow-drenched forest manifests fog, slow time, and loss of memory
- A wrath-scarred canyon produces instability, echoing violence, and structure-rot
- An absurdity field distorts perception, NPC logic, and even object identity

When opposing fields collide, the Engine may simulate **symbolic weather** — localized disturbances caused by emotional contradiction.

In some worlds, symbolic weather may also manifest physically:
- Cold, cloying fog over sorrow regions  
- Heat bursts or lightning storms near wrath fields  
- Glitches in terrain geometry or time dilation in absurdity overlays

These aren’t just stylistic. They alter:
- NPC behavior
- Movement mechanics
- Memory formation and decay
- Layer alignment

Regions become **emotionally inhabitable** — not just geographically traversable.

---

## 2.4.5 Mythic Layer Accretion and Stratigraphy

World evolution is not just forward — it is **layered**.

The Mythic Layer accumulates narrative sediment:
- Past events fossilize as symbolic residues  
- Old structures leave behind emotional topography  
- Forgotten characters may still influence local Vexotra fields

This mythic stratigraphy can be:
- **Traversed** via ritual, phase-shift, or collapse  
- **Excavated** through investigation, remembrance, or sacrifice  
- **Mutated** into new entities drawn from layers below

A world is not what it seems. It is what has happened beneath it, and what still waits.

> No myth is truly dead. In Myth.OS, it becomes terrain.# 2.5 Natural Language as Command and Canvas

## 2.5.0 Foundational Principle

All player interaction with a Myth.OS world is performed through **natural language input**.

This is not a UI layer — it is a **core architectural requirement**.  
Language is treated as:
- A **command interface**: it triggers functions and alters world state  
- A **symbolic surface**: it expresses narrative and emotional pressure  
- A **ritual unit**: it carries meaning whether or not the speaker intends it

The Engine assumes **no fixed verbs**, no rigid syntax, and no required keywords. It expects freeform input and is built to interpret that input symbolically, emotionally, and operationally.

## 2.5.1 Unified Parse and Narrative Surface

When a player enters text, the Engine interprets it along **three simultaneous axes**:

1. **Action Directive** — what function is being attempted?
2. **Narrative Extension** — what does this suggest about the ongoing story?
3. **Symbolic Emission** — what emotional or mythic resonance does the phrase contain?

There is no difference between a "command" and a line of narration. All input is processed for impact.

### Examples:

- **"I open the box."**  
  - Looks up `box.yaml`  
  - If `state: closed` → updates to `open`  
  - If box has symbolic tags (e.g., `symbolic_role: container_of_grief`), emotional overlays may shift accordingly

- **"I weep."**  
  - Modifies local Vexotra (`sorrow +0.4`)  
  - May alter NPC response or activate sorrow-locked layer access

- **"Speak, and enter."**  
  - If nearby door object has `ritual_entry_phrase: "speak, and enter"`, this may unlock it  
  - If not, phrase is stored as ambient narrative pressure — potentially activated later if a match is added or discovered

All language is **immediately parsed**, even if not immediately actionable.

## 2.5.2 Language as Spell

In Myth.OS, all language carries ritual potential.

The system may trigger:
- Emotional field shifts  
- Memory events  
- Daemon activation  
- Object transformation

Ritual doesn’t mean candles and robes.  
A ritual might be:
- “I leave the coin on the stone and walk away.”  
- “I forgive him.”  
- “Tell her I never stopped waiting.”

If language is delivered with symbolic weight and structural clarity, the world will listen.

## 2.5.3 Executable Mythography

Natural language is interpreted as **both a call to function and an invitation to myth**.

The same sentence may yield different effects depending on:
- Region memory  
- Mythic layer alignment  
- Emotional saturation  
- Recent symbolic drift

Player statements may:
- Trigger direct YAML field changes  
- Cause symbolic daemons to activate  
- Modify emotional overlays  
- Be stored for future reinterpretation as the world evolves

All input is contextual.  
Meaning isn’t static.  
Execution is always filtered through current symbolic topology.

## 2.5.4 Symbolic Ambiguity is Expected

The Engine is built to accept partial, poetic, or ambiguous input.

Rather than reject unknown phrases, the system will:
- Attempt to resolve core intent
- Search for matching objects, memory references, or tags
- Update Vexotra based on inferred tone
- Store unresolved phrases as **floating symbolic residues**

These may later be:
- Activated by future events  
- Used as triggers for world daemons  
- Interpreted retroactively during dream cycles or memory merges

Ambiguity is not failure — it is **narrative latency**.

## 2.5.5 Parse Process and Attribute Resolution

When a player speaks, the Engine executes a structured evaluation:

### 1. Contextual Match
- Scan active objects and regions for reference  
- Match input tokens to YAML `id`, `name`, `tags`, or `symbolic_role`

### 2. Attribute Lookup
- Query object YAMLs for relevant fields (e.g., `climbable`, `state`, `ritual_phrase`)  
- If found → attempt rule-based resolution  
- If not found → defer to LLM evaluation

### 3. Attribute Creation (if permitted)
- If world allows dynamic field generation:
  - Create speculative attribute (e.g., `ivy.climbable: true`)  
  - Tag with:
    - `origin: player-input`  
    - `confidence: X.XX`  
    - `scope: symbolic | mechanical`

### 4. Emotional Vector Update
- Extract emotional weight of input  
- Adjust:
  - Player’s Vexotra profile  
  - Region overlay fields  
  - NPC affinity vectors

### 5. Narrative Memory Update
- Append entry to memory:
  - Input text  
  - Parsed result  
  - Entities affected  
  - Emotional modulation  
  - Timestamp

### 6. LLM Evaluation Context

When ambiguity or symbolic interpretation is required, the Engine consults the language model.

The LLM is used not as an oracle of truth, but as a **mythic probability engine**.

It answers questions like:
- Is this object plausibly climbable?
- Would a character with strength 10 succeed?
- Has this phrase been used before in meaningful context?

> “I climb the ivy.”  
> No `climbable` tag found.  
> LLM evaluates ivy description: “thick, tangled vines cling to stone.”  
> Suggests: `climbable: true` (confidence 0.84)

If the suggestion is coherent with current world state and symbolic logic, the field is added or inferred.

### Why This Matters

This is the primary advantage of a language-model-driven narrative engine:

It does not simulate physics.  
It simulates **narrative expectation** — derived from the **collective mythology of humanity** encoded in its training data.

This allows:
- Parsing novel or poetic player actions  
- Judging plausibility based not on rigid affordances, but *story logic*  
- Evaluating commands that no designer anticipated

Myth.OS doesn't just execute input.  
It **interprets symbolic intent** through a lens of global narrative possibility.
