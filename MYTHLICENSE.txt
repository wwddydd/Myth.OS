# MYTHLICENSE.md  
*A note for those building strange systems.*

This isn’t a legal document. That’s the LICENSE file (Apache 2.0).  
This is a companion—a message from the engine’s makers to whoever picks up the torch.

## What Myth.OS Is

Myth.OS is a symbolic framework for constructing interactive worlds.

It’s designed for:
- Games that track meaning, not just state.
- Stories that evolve as they’re told.
- Simulations of belief, ritual, and symbolic logic.
- Systems where memory matters and causality bends.

It’s a toolkit for people building things that don’t fit in traditional engines.  
If you're here, you probably know what we mean.

## If You’re Using This

You can do whatever you want with it. That’s what the license says.

But for those of you doing something serious—serious like play, serious like myth—this file is for you.

We encourage you to:

- Treat your `.yaml` and `.txt` files like sacred texts. Comment them accordingly.
- Document emergent behavior—especially when it surprises you.
- Think carefully about narrative memory, symbolic geography, and how you name things.

This engine isn’t magic. But it’s designed to get out of your way if you try to build something that is.

## Attribution (Required by License)

If you fork this engine or build something based on it, you must retain the original license and attribution.

In practice, that means:

- Keep the `LICENSE` file (Apache 2.0).
- Include the `NOTICE` file with credit to Orion Systems.
- If you modify the engine, make a note of that in your `NOTICE`.

You can rename it. Fork it. Turn it into something unrecognizable. But the roots stay documented.

If you want to be generous with credit, we recommend:

> “Built on Myth.OS, originally developed by Orion Systems.”

## Final Thoughts

Myth.OS is a system. But it’s also a mirror.

When you build something with it, you’re not just writing code—you’re shaping how the world behaves, even if it's a world made of symbols.

Build something strange.  
Build something sincere.  
And if your world starts acting like it remembers you—don’t panic. Just keep going.
