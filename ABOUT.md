**What Is Myth.OS?**  
*A Systems Engine for Story, Structure, and Spirit*

---

**Overview**

Myth.OS is a modular narrative framework designed to model complex systems through story. It sits at the intersection of operational logic, interactive design, and living myth. Built from lived experience, broken machines, strange rituals, and practical repair work, Myth.OS exists to do one thing:

**Help people understand and navigate the systems they already live inside.**

It can be a creative tool, a diagnostic lens, a game engine, or a ritual map—depending on how you engage it. It is both software and practice. Myth.OS is not a product. It is a frame.

**Why Myth.OS Exists**

Because spreadsheets aren't the system.
Because the system doesn't know it's a story.
Because the story doesn't realize it's made of code, and code doesn't realize it's made of language.

We live inside constructed realities—some by design, some by accident. Myth.OS gives you the tools to explore, understand, and shape those realities without flattening them.

**Core Concepts**

- **Narrative as Operating Logic**  
  Every system—from organizations to bodies to cities—runs on a hidden story. Myth.OS helps surface that story, question its assumptions, and recode it intentionally.

- **Mythic Layering**  
  Myth.OS doesn't replace logic—it augments it. It adds resonance, archetype, and structure where things feel meaningless or stuck.

- **Agency Through Perspective**  
  When users understand the myth they're inside, they gain power over it. Myth.OS turns insight into navigation.

- **Interfaces for the Invisible**  
  Ritual, roleplay, creative coding, alternate reality interfaces—these are all valid expressions within Myth.OS. The system flexes to fit the shape of the user.

**Intended Use Cases**

- Designers building meaning-rich systems
- Facilitators creating immersive or transformative experiences
- Technologists seeking symbolic architecture
- Creative technomancers
- Anyone trying to navigate complex, surreal, or broken environments with integrity

**Status**

Myth.OS is in development. It exists in fragments: rituals, documents, interactions, and prototypes. It will eventually live as a public framework, toolkit, and archive—but it is already functional in field conditions.

You may have already used it. You may be using it now.

**For Inquiries or Collaboration**  
Get in touch if you're building something strange, systemic, or sacred. Myth.OS is looking for other nodes.
